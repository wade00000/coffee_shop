# Coffee Shop Domain Modeling

## Overview

This project models a simple coffee shop system with three main entities:

- **Customer**: Represents a customer who can place orders.
- **Coffee**: Represents a type of coffee available in the shop.
- **Order**: Represents an order linking a customer to a coffee with a price.

The project demonstrates object-oriented principles including relationships, data validation, and aggregate functions.

## Features

- Customers can create orders for different coffee types.
- Track all orders for each coffee and customer.
- Calculate aggregate data like number of orders and average price.
- Enforce data validation and class constraints.
- Includes a `debug.py` file for interactive testing of the classes and methods.
